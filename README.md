# xray-awvs
## about
awvs+xray combination scan small script, simple and practical, may be the most convenient scan script, suitable for batch scanning, considering the same vps deployment of awvs even for crawl only scan will be quite eat resources, so limited to a maximum of 6 targets at the same time crawl, of course, if the local machine running can adjust their own parameters, if you are willing to point a start, I will update the automatic login, automatic access to api_key function as soon as possible
